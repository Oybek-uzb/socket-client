# Socket-client
The client requires socket-server running on any port and running ws-port on :80.

For running client sockets just double-click on "index.html".

A client socket decides answering or not to the server. The server tries to be responded maximum 3 times.

Final result can be one of the following:

- client with id: someid has responded in N attempt(s)!

- client with id: someid has not responded in 3 attempts!
